# pacman-clone

Pacman clone done in HTML5 / JS. All engine code created from scratch without the use of frameworks, including collision detection, 
vector calculations, pathfinding, and ghost AI. Ghost AI is based on the documentation found at [this](http://gameinternals.com/post/2072558330/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior) link.

Each Ghost has its own unique 'personality' which drives its pathfinding algorithm.
